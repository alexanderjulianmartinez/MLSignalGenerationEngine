# MLSignalGenerationEngine
A machine learning signal generation engine to provide fresh signals with as close to a 10 minute delay as possible from
 real-time text documents.
 
 This repository contains data pipelines for ML signal generation to be used in a binary classification task setting.
 
 Storage if we want to reuse them across multiple different models for different ML tasks:
 - The generated ML signals would be stored in a cloud-based system (i.e. AWS S3) in parquet format for storage and 
 performance efficiency.
 - The data would be stored in a cloud-based storage, such as AWS S3.
